## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Welcome to the README for our project, "A Novel Used Car Price Prediction Model Based on LinDenoise." This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly leveraging the LinDenoise algorithm. By applying this novel approach, we intend to provide more accurate and reliable predictions for the used car market.
